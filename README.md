# Switcheroo
Web app that can be used to automatically load your favorite LLM while having all of the tech stack accustomed to your project!

## How it works
To start, you need to come to our website and register. After registration, you will be prompted to choose a list of tech stacks you use and our web crawler will extract the data obtained from the docs based on the list of predetermined websites that we have in our database. 

The data will be sanitized and fed to the chatbot AI of your choice. Then a dialogue with the AI will be initiated. Enjoy!

## Installation
as of now simply run this at the root directory 
```bash
npm install
```

## Tech stack used
Frontend:
- Shadcn/UI
